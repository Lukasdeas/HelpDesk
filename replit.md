# Overview

This is a comprehensive IT ticketing system built as a full-stack web application. The system enables users to submit support tickets and allows technicians and administrators to manage, assign, and resolve these tickets. It features role-based access control with three user types: regular users (ticket creators), technicians, and administrators.

The application provides a complete ticket management workflow including ticket creation, priority assignment, status tracking, commenting system, and reporting capabilities. It's designed for IT support teams to efficiently handle and track technical issues within an organization.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side is built using React with TypeScript and follows a component-based architecture. The application uses Wouter for client-side routing and TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management. The UI is built with Radix UI components and styled using Tailwind CSS with the shadcn/ui component library for a consistent design system.

Key frontend decisions:
- **React with TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better developer experience
- **Wouter**: Lightweight routing solution chosen over React Router for simplicity
- **TanStack Query**: Handles server state, caching, and synchronization automatically
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**: Utility-first CSS framework with pre-built accessible components
- **Vite**: Fast build tool for development and production builds

## Backend Architecture
The server follows a REST API architecture built with Express.js and TypeScript. The application uses a service layer pattern with a storage abstraction layer that implements database operations through Drizzle ORM.

Key backend decisions:
- **Express.js**: Mature and widely-adopted Node.js web framework
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Separates business logic from route handlers
- **Storage Abstraction**: Interface-based design allows for easy database switching
- **Middleware-based**: Uses Express middleware for logging, error handling, and request processing

## Data Storage Solutions
The application uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations. The database schema includes tables for users, tickets, and comments with proper relationships and constraints.

Key data decisions:
- **PostgreSQL**: Chosen for ACID compliance, complex queries, and scalability
- **Drizzle ORM**: Provides type safety and SQL-like query building
- **Neon Database**: PostgreSQL-compatible serverless database for cloud deployment
- **Connection Pooling**: Uses connection pooling for efficient database resource management

## Authentication and Authorization
The system implements a simple session-based authentication with role-based access control. Users are stored in the database with hashed passwords and assigned roles (technician or admin).

Key auth decisions:
- **Simple Password Auth**: Basic username/password authentication suitable for internal tools
- **Role-based Access**: Three distinct user roles with different permissions
- **Session Storage**: Uses localStorage for client-side session persistence
- **Server-side Validation**: All sensitive operations require server-side permission checks

## State Management
Client-side state is managed using TanStack Query for server state and React's built-in state management for UI state. Forms use React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling.

Key state decisions:
- **TanStack Query**: Automatically handles caching, background updates, and error states
- **React Hook Form**: Provides performant form handling with minimal re-renders
- **Zod Validation**: Ensures type safety between client and server validation schemas
